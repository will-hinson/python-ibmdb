 International Program License Agreement\par
 \par
 Part 1 - General Terms\par
 \par
 BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, CLICKING ON AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR OTHERWISE USING THE PROGRAM, LICENSEE AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND LICENSEE TO THESE TERMS.\par
 \par
 IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OR DO NOT HAVE AUTHORITY: i) DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, CLICK ON AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND ii) PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED MEDIA, DOCUMENTATION, AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM IT WAS OBTAINED FOR A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT PAID. IF THE PROGRAM WAS DOWNLOADED, DESTROY ALL COPIES OF THE PROGRAM.\par
 \par
 This International Program License Agreement (IPLA) and applicable Transaction Documents (together the "Agreement") are the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM regarding the use of a Program. The country required terms included in Part 2 of this IPLA replace or modify the terms of Part 1.\par
 \par
 Transaction Documents (TDs) provide a description, information, and terms regarding the Program and its authorized use. Examples of TDs for Programs include license information (LI), licensed program specifications (LPS), quote, proof of entitlement (PoE), or invoice. To the extent of any conflict a TD will prevail over the IPLA.\par
 \par
 1. Program License\par
 \par
 a. A Program is an executable IBM-branded computer program and its related material and includes whole and par
tial copies. Program details are described in a TD available at http://www.ibm.com/software/sla (for Passport Advantage Programs) or http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter (for other IBM Programs), in the Program's system command directory, or as otherwise specified by IBM. IBM software policies (such as backup, temporary use and IBM approved cloud environment) available at http://www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies apply to Licensee's use of Programs.\par
 \par
 b. Copies of Programs are copyrighted and licensed.\par
 \par
 c. Licensee is granted a nonexclusive license to:\par
 \par
 (1) use each copy of a Program, subject to the terms of the Agreement and up to the number of license entitlements Licensee acquires ("Authorized Use");\par
 \par
 (2) make and install copies to support such Authorized Use; and\par
 \par
 (3) make a backup copy.\par
 \par
 d. Programs may be used by Licensee, its employees and contractors. Licensee may not rent or lease a Program or provide commercial IT, hosting or timesharing services to any third par
ty. Additional rights may be available for additional fees or under different terms.\par
 \par
 e. The license granted for a Program is subject to Licensee:\par
 \par
 (1) reproducing copyright notices and other markings on any copy;\par
 \par
 (2) ensuring anyone who uses the Program: i) does so only on Licensee's behalf within Licensee's Authorized Use; and ii) complies with this Agreement;\par
 \par
 (3) not reverse assembling, reverse compiling, translating, or reverse engineering the Program, except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; and\par
 \par
 (4) not using any of the elements of the Program or related licensed materials separ
ately from the Program.\par
 \par
 f. If the TD for a Program ("Principal Program") states that a "Supporting Program" is included with the Principal Program, Licensee may use the Supporting Program subject to any license limitations of the Principal Program and only to support the Principal Program.\par
 \par
 g. This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.\par
 \par
 h. An update, fix, or patch to a Program is subject to the terms governing the Program unless new terms are provided in an updated TD. Licensee accepts such new terms upon installation of the update, fix, or patch. If a Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced Program.\par
 \par
 i. If Licensee is dissatisfied with a Program for any reason, Licensee may terminate the license by returning the Program and proof of entitlement to IBM or the authorized IBM Business Partner within 30 days of the original acquisition date of such Program for a refund of the amount paid. For a downloaded Program, contact the par
ty Licensee acquired the Program from for refund instructions.\par
 \par
 2. Warranties\par
 \par
 a. IBM warrants that a Program, when used in its specified operating environment conforms to its specifications. The warranty period for a Program is 12 months from acquisition, or the initial license term if less than 12 months, unless another warranty period is specified in the TD.\par
 \par
 b. During the warranty period Licensee will have access to IBM databases containing information on known Program defects, defect corrections, restrictions, and bypasses as described in the IBM Support Guide at http://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/733923.\par
 \par
 c. If the Program does not function as warranted during its warranty period and the problem cannot be resolved with information available in the IBM databases, Licensee may return the Program and proof of entitlement to IBM or the IBM Business Partner for a refund of the amount Licensee paid and Licensee's license terminates.\par
 \par
 d. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of an IBM Program or that IBM will correct all defects or prevent third par
ty disruptions. These warranties are the exclusive warranties from IBM and replace all other warranties, including the implied warranties or conditions of satisfactory quality, merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a par
ticular purpose. IBM warranties will not apply if there has been misuse, modification, damage not caused by IBM, or failure to comply with written instructions provided by IBM. Non-IBM Programs are provided as-is, without warranties of any kind. Third par
ties may provide their own warranties to Licensee.\par
 \par
 e. Additional support available during or after the warranty period may be available under separ
ate agreement.\par
 \par
 3. Charges, Taxes, Payment, and Verification\par
 \par
 a. Licensee's right to use a Program is contingent on Licensee paying applicable charges as specified in the agreement under which Licensee acquired the license entitlements. Licensee is responsible to acquire additional license entitlements in advance of any increase of its use.\par
 \par
 b. Licensee agrees to pay all applicable charges for acquired entitlements and any charges for use in excess of authorizations. Charges are exclusive of any customs or other duty, tax, and similar levies imposed by any authority resulting from Licensee's acquisition of entitlements and will be invoiced in addition to such charges. Amounts are due upon receipt of the invoice from IBM and payable within 30 days of the invoice date to an account specified by IBM and late payment fees may apply. Licensee is responsible to properly acquire additional license entitlements in advance to increase its use. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as specified elsewhere in this IPLA, the applicable TD, or terms of the agreement under which Licensee acquired license entitlements.\par
 \par
 c. Based on acquired entitlements, Licensee agrees to: i) pay any withholding tax directly to the appropriate government entity where required by law; ii) furnish a tax certificate evidencing such payment to IBM; iii) pay IBM only the net proceeds after tax; and iv) fully cooperate with IBM in seeking a waiver or reduction of such taxes and promptly complete and file all relevant documents.\par
 \par
 d. If Licensee imports, exports, transfers, accesses, or uses a Program across a border, Licensee agrees to be responsible for and pay authorities any custom, duty, tax, or similar levy assessed by the authorities. This excludes those taxes based on IBM's net income.\par
 \par
 3.1 Licensing Verification\par
 \par
 a. Licensee will, for all Programs at all sites and for all environments, create, retain, and each year provide to IBM upon request with 30 days' advance notice: i) a report, in a format requested by IBM using records, system tools output, and other system information; and ii) supporting documentation (collectively, "Deployment Data").\par
 \par
 b. Upon reasonable notice, IBM and its independent auditors may verify Licensee's compliance with this Agreement, at all sites and for all environments, in which Licensee uses (for any purposes) Programs. Verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee's business and may be conducted on Licensee's premises, during normal business hours. IBM will have a written confidentiality agreement with the independent auditor. In addition to providing Deployment Data described above, Licensee agrees to provide to IBM and its auditors additional accurate information and Deployment Data upon request.\par
 \par
 c. Licensee will promptly order and pay charges at IBM's then current rates associated with: i) any deployments in excess of authorizations indicated on or by any annual report or verification; ii) applicable subscription & support services (S&S) for such excess deployments for the lesser of the duration of such excess use or two years; and iii) any additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of such verification, including but not limited to taxes, duties, and regulatory fees.\par
 \par
 4. Liability and Intellectual Property Protection\par
 \par
 a. IBM's entire liability for all claims related to this Agreement will not exceed the amount of any actual direct damages incurred by Licensee up to the amounts paid (if recurring charges, up to 12 months' charges apply) for the entitlements to the Program that is the subject of the claim, regardless of the basis of the claim. IBM will not be liable for special, incidental, exemplary, indirect, or economic consequential damages, or for lost profits, business, value, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings. These limitations apply collectively to IBM, its affiliates, contractors, and suppliers.\par
 \par
 b. The following amounts are not subject to the above cap: i) third par
ty payments related to infringement claims described in clause 4 c below; and ii) damages that cannot be limited under applicable law.\par
 \par
 c. If a third par
ty asserts a claim against Licensee that an IBM Program infringes a patent or copyright, IBM will defend Licensee against that claim and pay amounts finally awarded by a court against Licensee or included in a settlement approved by IBM. To obtain IBM's defense against and payment of infringement claims, Licensee must promptly: i) notify IBM in writing of the claim; ii) supply information requested by IBM; and iii) allow IBM to control, and reasonably cooperate in, the defense and settlement, including mitigation efforts. IBM's defense and payment obligations for infringement claims extend to claims of infringement based on open source code that IBM selects and embeds in an IBM Program.\par
 \par
 d. IBM has no responsibility for claims based on non-IBM products, items not provided by IBM, or any violation of law or third par
ty rights caused by Content, or any Licensee materials, designs, specifications, or use of a non-current version or release of an IBM Program when an infringement claim could have been avoided by using a current version or release. Content consists of all data, software, and information that Licensee or its authorized users provide, authorize access to, or inputs to a Program.\par
 \par
 5. Termination\par
 \par
 a. IBM may terminate Licensee's license to use a Program if Licensee fails to comply with the IPLA, TDs or acquisition agreements, such as the International Passport Advantage Agreement (IPAA). Licensee will promptly destroy all copies of the Program after license termination. Any terms that by their nature extend beyond the termination remain in effect until fulfilled and apply to successors and assignees.\par
 \par
 6. Governing Laws and Geographic Scope\par
 \par
 a. Both par
ties agree to the application of the laws of the country where the transaction for license entitlements is performed, without regard to conflict of law principles. The rights and obligations of each par
ty are valid only in the country where the transaction to acquire license entitlements is performed or, if IBM agrees, the country where the Program is placed in productive use, except all licenses are valid as specifically granted.\par
 \par
 b. Each par
ty is also responsible for complying with: i) laws and regulations applicable to its business and Content; and ii) import, export and economic sanction laws and regulations, including the defense trade control regime of the United States of America and any applicable jurisdictions, that prohibit or restrict the import, export, re-export, or transfer of products, technology, services or data, directly or indirectly, to or for certain countries, end uses or end users.\par
 \par
 c. If any provision of this Agreement for a Program, is invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect. Nothing in this Agreement affects statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to transactions under this Agreement.\par
 \par
 7. General\par
 \par
 a. IBM is an independent contractor, not Licensee's agent, joint venturer, par
tner, or fiduciary, and does not undertake to perform any of Licensee's regulatory obligations, or assume any responsibility for Licensee's business or operations. Licensee is responsible for its use of IBM Programs and Non-IBM Programs. IBM is acting as an information technology provider only. IBM's direction, suggested usage, or guidance or use of a Program does not constitute medical, clinical, legal, accounting, or other licensed professional advice. Licensee should obtain its own expert advice.\par
 \par
 b. For Programs IBM provides to Licensee in tangible form, IBM fulfills its shipping and delivery obligations upon the delivery of such Programs to the IBM-designated carrier, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Licensee and IBM.\par
 \par
 c. Licensee may not use the Program if failure of the Program could lead to death, serious bodily injury, or property or environmental damage.\par
 \par
 d. IBM, its affiliates, and contractors of either require use of business contact information and certain account usage information. This information is not Content. Business contact information is used to communicate and manage business dealings with the Licensee. Examples of business contact information include name, business telephone, address, email, user ID, and tax registration information. Account usage information is required to enable, provide, manage, support, administer, and improve Programs. Examples of account usage information include reported errors and digital information gathered using tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, during use of the Programs. The IBM Privacy Statement at http://www.ibm.com/privacy provides additional details with respect to IBM's collection, use, and handling of business contact and account usage information. When Licensee provides information to IBM and notice to, or consent by, the individuals is required for such processing, Licensee will notify individuals and obtain consent.\par
 \par
 e. IBM Business Partners who use or make available Programs are independent from IBM and unilaterally determine their prices and terms. IBM is not responsible for their actions, omissions, statements, or offerings.\par
 \par
 f. IBM may offer Non-IBM Programs, or an IBM Program may enable access to Non-IBM Programs, that may require acceptance of third par
ty terms identified in a TD or presented to the Licensee. Linking to or use of Non-IBM Programs constitutes Licensee's agreement with such terms. IBM is not a par
ty to any third par
ty agreement and is not responsible for such Non-IBM Programs.\par
 \par
 g. License grants to Programs are provided by International Business Machines Corporation, a New York corporation ("IBM Corporation"). The IBM company from which the Licensee acquires entitlements ("IBM") is acting as a distributor and delivering Programs and is responsible for enforcing the terms of this Agreement. If entitlements are acquired from an IBM Business Partner, the IBM company for the country of acquisition is responsible for enforcing the terms of this Agreement. No right or cause of action is created in favor of Licensee against IBM Corporation. Licensee waives all claims and causes of action against IBM Corporation and agrees to look solely to IBM for any rights and remedies in connection with Programs.\par
 \par
 h. Licensee may not sublicense, assign, or transfer the license for any Program (except to the extent assignment or transfer may not be legally restricted or as is expressly permitted in a TD or as otherwise agreed by IBM). IBM may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement in conjunction with the sale of the portion of IBM's business that includes a Program. IBM may share this Agreement and related documents in conjunction with any assignment.\par
 \par
 i. All notices under the Agreement must be in writing and sent to the business address specified in the agreement Licensee acquired the license entitlements unless a par
ty designates in writing a different address. The par
ties consent to the use of electronic means and facsimile transmissions for communications as a signed writing. Any reproduction of the Agreement made by reliable means is considered an original. Agreement supersedes any course of dealing, discussions or representations, between the par
ties.\par
 \par
 j. No right or cause of action for any third par
ty is created by the Agreement. Neither par
ty will bring a legal action arising out of or related to the Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose. Neither par
ty is responsible for failure to fulfill its non-monetary obligations due to causes beyond its control. Each par
ty will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims the other has not met its obligations.\par
 \par
 k. IBM may use personnel and resources in locations worldwide, including third par
ty contractors to support the delivery of Programs and Program support. Licensee's use of Programs may result in the transfer of Content, including personally identifiable information, across country borders to provide Program support as described in the IBM Software Support Guide.\par
 \par
 Part 2 - Country Required Terms\par
 \par
 For licenses acquired in the countries specified below, the following terms replace or modify the referenced terms of this IPLA. Terms not changed by these amendments remain unchanged and in effect.\par

 \par
 Add at the end of par
agraph c the following sentence:\par
 \par
 In United States: The par
ties agree no tangible personal property (e.g. media or publications) shall transfer to Licensee if: i) IBM delivers Programs electronically to Licensee; or ii) Licensee claims a sales or use tax exemption for Programs IBM delivers electronically to Licensee.
